# MiGUE-Pipeline ☆´∀｀☆

Welcome to the **MiGUE-Pipeline** repository!!!

### Project Status: Work in Progress (WIP)
This repository currently hosts the **original pipeline code** used during the research and development phase. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **A quick heads-up:** As this is the raw implementation & all the codes are finished by my own, some modules might be a bit "rough around the edges" and are currently undergoing significant refactoring and polishing...（o´ﾟ□ﾟ`o）

### Roadmap
- **Current Version:** Raw experimental scripts and logic.
- **March 2026 (End of Month):** I will release the **Refined & Polished Version**
---

### Stay Tuned!
Happy Lunar New Year! Since it's currently the Spring Festival holiday (2026.2.16-2026.3.3), the update progress will be slightly slower o(TωT)o . I’ll be back to full speed soon!
If you have any urgent questions or want to discuss the pipeline logic, feel free to open an **Issue**. 

**The polished version is coming soon! Thanks for your patience**
